The __Funeral Interchange Data Object (FIDO)__ is a JSON format specifically designed to facilitate seamless data exchange among diverse stakeholders involved in the funeral process.

See [fidoformat.org](https://www.fidoformat.org) for the specification of this format. The format specification is made available in the form of a JSON Schema, as well as C# and TypeScript models.

The primary application for FIDO at present involves integrating the [Trauerdruck App](https://www.trauerdruck.app) with funeral software from various vendors. However, we encourage additional software vendors to participate in the further development of this format, fostering a collaborative environment that enables funeral homes to conduct data exchange with greater ease.

Get in contact with info@fidoformat.org if you are interested in using the FIDO format in your software.
