# About FIDO

The Funeral Interchange Data Object (FIDO) is a JSON format specifically designed to facilitate seamless data exchange among diverse stakeholders involved in the funeral process.

The current version, 0.1, documented on this website, was officially released on July 20, 2023. The format specification is made available in the form of a [JSON Schema](./jsonschema), as well as [C#](./csharp) and [TypeScript](./typescript) models.

The primary application for FIDO at present involves integrating the [Trauerdruck App](https://www.trauerdruck.app) with the [Clever One](https://www.cleverone.io) funeral software. However, we encourage other software vendors to participate in the further development of this format, fostering a collaborative environment that enables funeral homes to conduct data exchange with greater ease.
