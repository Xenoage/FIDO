# About FIDO

The Funeral Interchange Data Object (FIDO) is a JSON format specifically designed to facilitate seamless data exchange among diverse stakeholders involved in the funeral process.

The current version, 0.4.0, documented on this website, was released on October 21, 2024. The format specification is made available in the form of a [JSON Schema](./jsonschema), as well as [C#](./csharp) and [TypeScript](./typescript) models. [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Fido/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@xenoage/fido) packages are available, and the sources are published on [GitHub](https://www.github.com/Xenoage/FIDO).

The primary application for FIDO at present involves integrating the [Trauerdruck App](https://www.trauerdruckapp.de) with funeral software from
various vendors. However, we encourage additional software vendors to participate in the further development of this format, fostering a collaborative environment that enables funeral homes to conduct data exchange with greater ease.
